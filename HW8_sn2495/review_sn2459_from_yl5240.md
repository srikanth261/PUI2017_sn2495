The plot below is from HW8 of Namuduri Srikanth, sn2495. It could be found on https://github.com/srikanth261/PUI2017_sn2495/tree/master/HW8_sn2495.

This plot has quite clear to show the trend of top 5 cities’ house price from Oct. 2016 to Sep. 2017.
Though, some details could be improved:
1) The y label. I suppose the unit should be $1000. ‘(1000s of $)’ is hard to understand.
2) The legend location. The center of a plot is not a good position for putting a legend. The reason is that it would be too eye-catching for a legend, which should just be an element for   supplementary instruction.
3) The y lim. Because the lowest city, Philadelphia, is below 200k(?), the ylim could be set as (0,1000).  Such change will make the lowest line higher and the highest line lower in the plot, to squeeze the lines more clustered in the center of the plot. I think it's more aesthetic than leaving the lines spreading by the top and bottom of a picture. It could also offer the space for putting the legend on the upper-left, which will be helpful to address the second concern mentioned above.
4) The caption. It is better to describe the period of Oct. 2016 to Sep. 2017 instead of 'over the past 12 months'.

Despite of a few little remmondations made above, overall it's a pretty successful plot to convey the key information. I can get what the author want to express in less than 3 seconds and quickly have a whole picture for TOP 5 housing market in U.S.. Well done!
